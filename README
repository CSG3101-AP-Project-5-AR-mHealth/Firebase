The api is best run in a python virtual environment either, this can be done through Anaconda or the following python instructions:

Create the virtual environment:
  python -m venv C:\whereever\nameofenv

Run the virtual environment:
  C:\whereever\nameofenv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies, navigate to the Firebase git repository then run:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the django server, navigate to the Firebase git repository then run:
  cd api
  python manage.py runsslserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Access to api via https://<LanIpOfApiPc>:8000/<endpoint>/

#######
Notes:

You will need the ip address that the django server is running on, this will be
the local area network address of the machine you are running it on. You can get This
by opening a command prompt and running ipconfig and looking for the IPv4 Address entry.
You will need to enter this ip address into the android application settings page, with
the port number 8000.

Endpoint routes are specified in the /api/api/urls.py file, these use a list of url
patterns that specify the endpoint name and the view method that handles requests
to that endpoint.

View methods are located in /api/webapi/views.py.

Adding/removing/modifying /api/webapi/models.py will require making a migration
by running:
  python manage.py migrate

Ensure any addition/removing of model fields also get updated in /api/webapi/serializers.py
to enable correct json serialization/deserialzation.
